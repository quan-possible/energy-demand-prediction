This project aims to predict aggregate electricity demand from a selected list of locations in the City of Helsinki by using the 3 leading methods: a classical Box-Jenkins model, a Deep Learning Neural Network, and a Facebook Prophet model.

The project itself is divided into 2 parts. The first one is about predicting *daily* electricity demand using the first 2 models. The second part use Facebook Prophet to do forecasting on *hourly* demand.

The data is fetched from the Nuuka open API, courtesy of Avoindata.fi.
