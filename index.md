Introduction
============

This project aims to predict aggregate electricity demand from a
selected list of locations in the City of Helsinki using the classical
Box-Jenkins method, a Deep Learning model, and a Facebook Prophet model.

This project consists of two parts. The first part is about predicting
daily electricity demand with the Box-Jenkins method and the Deep
Learning model. The second part is about predicting hourly electricity
demand using Facebook Prophet.
