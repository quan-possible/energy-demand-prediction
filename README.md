# Energy Demand Prediction
a project

This project aims to predict aggregate electricity demand from a selected list of locations in the City of Helsinki by using the 3 arguably most popular methods: the classical Box-Jenkins method, a Deep Learning model, and a Facebook Prophet model.

The project itself is divided into 3 parts. The first part is about predicting *daily* electricity demand using the first 2 models. The second part use Facebook Prophet to do forecasting on *hourly* demand.
